# Raspberrian Buster Lite with openconnect
Slightly edited image of Raspberrian Buster Lite, with Openconnect installed.
I have gone through pains of sharing internet connections on a linux device.
But here so you people won't have that problem anymore is the image/iso-file I used.

## Warning 
/etc/networking/interfaces is slightly edited. Well you can change it easily, there is lecture for that all over the place. 
Use of the image on your own behalf, I swear we didn't change anything else, but who can you really trust on the internet.


(Many tutorials, all were correct but a single hint were missing. ip route add default via <address> was missing. I guess I will write a short script which enables automatically later)
